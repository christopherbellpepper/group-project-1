1. Login or Create a user profile
2. Once, you've entered the app, create a wish list of Bucket List items you'd like to accomplish.
3. You may edit this items from the list or delete them at any time.
4. When these list items are created, the app generates map data and general info for what you're looking to do.
5. The idea is to track, log and inspire people to create memories and achieve goals, in other words, don't die with regrets!!!
6. Future updates would include a "done" list, populating more exact data for return results, and linking to other users to compare lists, etc.
